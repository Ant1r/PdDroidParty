<h3>How to make patches for PdDroidParty</h3>

<p>1. Create a new Pd patch called droidparty_main.pd in a subdirectory. This
patch will contain your GUI objects like sliders, toggles, numberboxes etc. If
you have an existing patch you want to run with PdDroidParty you can create the
droidparty_main.pd patch in the same directory.</p>

<p>2. PdDroidParty GUI patches will be scaled to fit the screen of the device.
Your patches should have the rough dimensions of a phone/tablet in landscape
mode (e.g. 3:2 aspect ratio or e.g. 480x320 should usually work well). If it's
not exact it doesn't matter - the GUI elements will be scaled.</p>

<p>3. Numberbox, Sliders, Toggle, Comment, Bang, and Canvas are currently rendered by PdDroidParty, although not feature complete. Check out the GUI abstractions in the droidparty-abstractions.tgz file - these are also supported natively. See the Abstractions section below for more details.</p>

<p>4. All GUI elements should communicate with the main audio patches using send
and receive only. You can usually set send and receive for each GUI by right
clicking on the object and choosing 'properties' in Pd. Do not directly connect
cables to the GUI elements as they won't work. It helps to keep the GUIs on
their own in the droidparty_main.pd file and have it include the logic of your
patch as an abstraction or subpatch containing senders and receivers for
interfacing with GUI elements. This is good patch design practice anyway as it
is basically a model-view-controller methodology.</p>

<p>5. Copy the entire directory containing your droidparty_main.pd somewhere onto
the sdcard of your device. You can usually do this over USB with most phones
and tablets by mounting your device as a hard drive on your computer. One good
place to copy it is to e.g. /sdcard/pd/MyPdPatch</p>

<p>6. Run PdDroidParty and you will find an entry named after your subdirectory. Tap it to load your patch.</p>

<h3>Abstractions</h3>

<p>As well as the supported internal objects listed above the following abstractions work in Pd and are emulated natively on the device. Load the file droidparty-abstractions/_OVERVIEW.pd for more details and specific usage:</p>

<ul>
	<li>[wordbutton] - It's like a bang, but on the device it looks like a box with a word in it.</li>
	<li>[numberbox] - It's like a numberbox, but on the device it stretches to fit a rectangle. (easier layout).</li>
	<li>[taplist] - Lets the user tap through a list of symbols/floats.</li>
	<li>[touch] - Kaospad style 2d touch surface.</li>
	<li>[menubang] - Puts an entry into the menu which sends a bang when the user selects it. Optional icon is called menubang-xxxx.png where xxxx is the name of your menubang.</li>
	<li>[loadsave] - Wraps and openpanel/savepanel type of interface into a single abstraction that lets the user specify or choose filenames using the Android interface.</li>
</ul>
